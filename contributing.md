# Contributing to How We Have Been Saving The Planet This Week

You can help out by suggesting stories and subjects to [helpdesk@newatoms.com](mailto:helpdesk@newatoms.com). The newsletter and it's site are open source, you can contribute directly on [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/newatoms/hwhbstptw).

## Making a new newsletter on GitHub

1. Make a new branch or fork for this newsletter called `newsletter/` and the issue number, eg: `newsletter/26`.
1. Make a new newsletter file in the `newsletters` folder, the file should be named `YYYY-MM-DD-` and the issue number and the extension `.md`, eg: `2015-12-12-26.md`.
2. You can add images to the newsletters folder (with a GIT client or GitHub desktop) to use in your email but please name them connected to the issue, eg: `2015-12-12-26-tesla-roadster.jpg`
3. When finished you can [open a pull request](https://github.com/newatoms/hwhbstptw/compare?expand=1), this is a centralised place for final checking and where we discuss the issue. On resolving the Pull Request we copy and paste the contents into MailChimp to send it to our subscribers.

Pay attention to the format of the newsletter, you can find this in the [format.md](http://github.com/newatoms/hwhbstptw/format.md).

## Contributing to the website

The website runs on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and is generated by [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com/). Make any edits you wish on your own branch/fork and create a pull request to suggest changes.

The `gh-pages` branch is the branch that is published on [howwehavebeensavingtheplanetthisweek.com](howwehavebeensavingtheplanetthisweek.com)
