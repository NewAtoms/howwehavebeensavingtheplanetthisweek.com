We use Mailchimp to send the newsletter each week. This is done by the folks at @newatoms, but if you think you could help them sending it out, drop a line to [helpdesk@newatoms.com](mailto:helpdesk@newatoms.com).

# How to send the newsletter

1. Make a new campaign in MailChimp if there isn’t one, give it a new number and call it ‘How We Have Been Saving The Planet This Week #[_insert number here_]’.

2. Create subject line for the new newsletter.

3. Insert the image from the original article and links to the articles to the title, a ‘read more on …’ at the bottom and image.

4. What is the most important takeaways according to us, what is the thing in this article that we think makes it change the world for the better and we can pat ourselves on the back for it. Add some emoji wherever relevant.

5. If the email has 3-5 links and it feels complete. Add an **AWESOME** GIF to the bottom of the mail!

6. Write an introduction summarising what is in the newsletter, have some bullet points that are crazy exciting and lure the reader in.

7. Write a sign-off, including a ‘We love you note’ or some sort of ‘Happy weekend’ or thanking the readers. Perhaps invite them to take part in the development.

8. Write a news related teaser that is above the header image, this is what readers see below the subject line in their mail client. Keep it short and snappy.  This can be in Emoji!

9. Write the subject line that is a title, a teaser that hints about the importance and excitingness of the contents. And explosive with emojï.

10. Turn on the Social Card. The title should be the subject line, and below that the teaser. It has to lure the viewer into clicking. This is our click-bait.

11. Have someone final-check it, and that person can then schedule it for 1500z on Friday.

12. Move the newsletter to the folder ‘How We Have Been Saving The Planet This Week’ this makes it appear in on the Website.

13. **PARTY**
