# Fucking Awesome Things, Every Week, Sign Up Now!

Tired of getting apocalyptic news about climate change? Do you feel powerless and depressed about the future of the planet? Ready to turn your pessimistic future views a 180 degrees? You're now at the right spot:

[How We Have Been Saving The Planet This Week 🌏👊](http://www.howwehavebeensavingtheplanetthisweek.com/)

A positive and exciting newsletter about all the awesome things we —mankind— do every week to improve our environment.

Every week we find the coolest articles and make a short explanatory paragraph about what awesomeness it is about. We do this with an accessible, and perhaps sometimes, nerdy way of informal storytelling. Like we would to our friends in the pub, when we try to convince them that ant poop inspired a new type of fuel.

Fucking Awesome Things, Every Week.
