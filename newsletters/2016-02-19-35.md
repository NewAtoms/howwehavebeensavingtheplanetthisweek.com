# [Google's car computer fits the legal definition of a human ðŸ˜±!](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/09/google-computers-self-driving-cars-human)

How's that for a philosophical start?

"The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) has ruled that the software behind some automated cars should be considered the driver."

This is a huge step for car companies who are testing autonomous cars. This ruling could be the beginning of mass production an thus consumption.

The autonomous car is clean because they're powered by electricity, so there are no gas emissions from the car itself. They drive themselves turns out, the computer is a far better driver than humans. Napping ðŸ˜´ behind the steering wheel, we would want one, most definitely!

# [Pioneering island Sumba ðŸŒ´ is going for 100% renewable ](http://www.climatecentral.org/news/small-island-offers-big-lessons-clean-power-20029)

The [beautiful island Sumba](http://bit.ly/1OgaII2) in Indonesia has an abundance of natural wind, solar and flowing water.  

Different kinds of programs are working with the local government. They already have a lot of households powered with biogas, solar, wind and water energy.

There's an organisation that is teaching the Sumba citizens to make their own little hydropower plants and they get skilled on how to do maintenance ðŸ› . Way better than the dangerous kerosine that most of the islanders are still relying on.  

This article from [Climate Central](http://www.climatecentral.org/news/small-island-offers-big-lessons-clean-power-20029) really is making you happy ðŸ˜Š!
