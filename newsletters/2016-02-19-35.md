# [Google's car computer fits the legal definition of a human üò±!](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/09/google-computers-self-driving-cars-human)

How's that for a philosophical start?

"The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) has ruled that the software behind some automated cars should be considered the driver."

This is a huge step for car companies who are testing autonomous cars. This ruling could be the beginning of mass production an thus consumption.

The autonomous car is clean because they're powered by electricity, so there are no gas emissions from the car itself. They drive themselves turns out, the computer is a far better driver than humans. Napping üò¥ behind the steering wheel, we would want one, most definitely!

# [Pioneering island Sumba üå¥ is going for 100% renewable ](http://www.climatecentral.org/news/small-island-offers-big-lessons-clean-power-20029)

The [beautiful island Sumba](http://bit.ly/1OgaII2) in Indonesia has an abundance of natural wind, solar and flowing water.  

Different kinds of programs are working with the local government. They already have a lot of households powered with biogas, solar, wind and water energy.

There's an organisation that is teaching the Sumba citizens to make their own little hydropower plants and they get skilled on how to do maintenance üõ†. Way better than the dangerous and filthy kerosine that most of the islanders are still relying on. The plan is to ban kerosine in

# [Air pollution Hebei, China has fallen 28% in 2 years](http://www.climatechangenews.com/2016/02/15/smoggy-hebei-offers-hope-china-can-win-war-on-air-pollution/)

[The province of Hebei, China](http://bit.ly/1QICM8W) is surrounding Beijing. It's one of China's most heavily industrialised provinces. Environment experts think Hebei is pointed by the Chinese government to give a good example to the rest of China.

Although there are a lot of obstacles, this case shows that it's possible to make a difference in slowing down air pollution in one of the most polluted arias of the world. Is it just a matter of prioritising?
