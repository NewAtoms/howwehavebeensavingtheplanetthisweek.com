# [Melting salt powers moroccan city at night ](http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-35498592)

Lawrence of Arabia, The Mummy, and the Game of Thrones has been filmed near Ouarzazate, Morocco. So, where there is enough place for epic battle armies, on the edge of the Sahara dessert, a massive solar farm emerges.

The city of Ouarazate needs power at night from solar energy, here's where the melting salt comes in. First, the mirrors on the solar panels heat oil running through pipes. Then the oil (that of course can be reused) heats a huge silo full of salt, melts it and uses the energy to light up the city.

Getting hot already?
