# Happy New Year ðŸŽ†

In the first newsletter this year:

* How we have been saving the planet in 2015.
* How a giant underwater balloon will help store our energy.
* Biking will be much more fun if we do it like these two countries.

# [Some great strides made in 2015](http://grist.org/climate-energy/heres-the-good-news-about-earth-from-this-year/)

* It looks like world leaders embraced the alarming science about climate change and are finally ready to do something about it. The Climate Conference in Paris was a big step in forming the foundation to step up our game ðŸ’ª and save the planet.

* More and more countries preserve their waters. This year, an ocean [the size of Texas](http://bit.ly/1Tvi7bd) was preserved!

* 2015 was also the beginning of the end of the polluting car. More and more car companies are going electric and new brands emerged. [An increasing number](http://www.bikeleague.org/commutingdata) of people cycleðŸš² to work. Young people are no longer interested in owning cars and make different choices when it comes to 'buying their freedom'.

* The renewable energy economy is growing faster than hummingbirds can flap their wings and the prices of clean energy are dropping like Skrillex drops his bass ðŸ’¥.

Almost every week we can present a new form of storing sustainable energy! This time: A giant underwater balloon. The balloon is filled with high-pressured air which can be released to generate electricity when sustainable resources won't generate enough, a good night sleep without worries. The balloons are ideally placed 200 meters below sea level because the pressure will be equal on the inside and on the outside. Company Hydrostar promises 80% efficiency. Isn't that resourceful?!

# Good news for European ðŸšµcyclists!

It always feels like such a waste if you have to stop for other traffic while cycling. Denmark and Germany are helping cyclists by severely reducing the amount of times they have to hit the breaks. Denmark is testing with identification tags on wheels to signal upcoming traffic light to turn green.

Germany is taking another approach, it's building bicycle superhighways. These highways span more than 60 miles and connect ten cities. Lights allow cyclists to return home after sunset and snow is removed in the winter to ensure the highway can be used year round. Great work!
