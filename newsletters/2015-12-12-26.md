# Say what? Batteries made out of paper?
Swedish scietists believe they invented a breakthrough in the energy storage technology. This technique could store large amounts of energy on paper in a sustainable manner. It's called, Power 💪🏼 Paper!

With some upgrades, normal paper can act like a supercapacitor. The researchers believe that in future these thick layers of Power Paper can function for storing energy from wind, solar and other renewable sources. 

In future — scientists believe — it wil be safe, less expensive and lightweighted, thus realy scalable. It's waterproof and foldable. What more do you want?

# What the hack is this image all about?
Humans are revolutionising flying by using solar power, but it will still take a while before commercial airplanes are ready for take off. While we wait for that cool event to happen, lets go for biofuels. Biofuels are a much cleaner way to fly and better: we can grow it sustainable 😌.  

The aviation ✈️ industry is heavily experimenting with biofuels to fly more clean and with renewable sources. One of the most promising is the use of _halophytes_. 

The image above explaines the pruduction of these biofuels. They can grow in salty waters 🌊! So, a lot of space, don't you think? Halophytes can also use aquaculture waste as fertilizer.

# Africa pledged restoring 100 million hectares of trees 😮!
A big number of African countries have pledged to restore the continents forrests by 2030. It's a big plan to battle the systematic deforrestation. Togheter with tackling illigal logging this could be a major step forward improving Africa's lungs

Here you see what a combined 100 million hectares of forrest (386,000 square miles) looks like:
