# Say what? Batteries made out of paper?
Swedish scietists believe they invented a breakthrough in the energy storage technology. This technique could store large amounts of energy on paper in a sustainable manner. It's called, Power 💪🏼 Paper!

With some upgrades, normal paper can act like a supercapacitor. The researchers believe that in future these thick layers of Power Paper can function for storing energy from wind, solar and other renewable sources. 
In future — scientists believe — it wil be safe, less expensive and lightweighted, thus realy scalable. It's waterproof and foldable. What more do you want?
