# Say what? Batteries made out of paper?

Swedish scientists believe they invented a breakthrough in energy storage technology. This technique could store large amounts of energy on paper in a sustainable manner. It's called, Power 💪🏼 Paper!

With some upgrades, normal paper can act like a supercapacitor, a kind of super-battery. The researchers believe that in the future these thick layers of Power Paper can function to store energy from wind, solar and other renewable sources. 

In future — scientists believe — Power Paper can be safe, less expensive and lightweight, thus realy scalable. It's waterproof and foldable. What more do you want?

# Africa pledges to restore 100 million hectares of trees 😮!

A big number of African countries have pledged to restore all of the continents forests by 2030. It's a big plan to battle the systematic deforestation. Togheter with tackling illigal logging this could be a major step forward improving the lungs of Africa.

Here you see what a combined 100 million hectares of forrest (386,000 square miles) looks like:

# What the heck is this image all about?

Humans are revolutionising flying by using solar power, but it will still take a while before commercial airplanes are ready for take-off. While we wait for that to happen we can use biofuels. Biofuels are a much cleaner way to fly and better, plus we can grow it sustainably 😌.  

The aviation ✈️ industry is heavily experimenting with biofuels to fly cleaner and with renewable sources. One of the most promising is the use of _halophytes_. 

The image above explaines the pruduction of these biofuels. They can grow in salty waters 🌊! So, a lot of space, don't you think? Halophytes can also use aquaculture waste as fertilizer.
