# [Al Gore is back! Look what happened since the Inconvenient Truth](https://www.ted.com/talks/al_gore_the_case_for_optimism_on_climate_change)

Yes, remember [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnjx6KETmi4) very popular documentary from Al Gore when he warned us for apocalyptic times to come? Well, that was released in the year 2006 (see the white arrow in the graph within the image above).

Now the climate change preacher 🎤 shows us that there is proof that we certainly **can** save the planet. Be warned though, as Gore still didn't lose his ability to remember you of all the dangers we're facing. At one point he says: “Every night on the TV news is like a nature hike through the [Book of Revelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Revelation)” 😂.

We'd advice you to Skip to exactly **12:49** 🕗and see that humans are capable of developing ideas and changing their own future exponentially!

# [Mass market of electric cars is coming](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/25/electric-cars-will-be-cheaper-than-conventional-vehicles-by-2022)

The overall costs of electric cars will be cheaper than conventional cars in 2022. That's what Bloomberg analysts predict. This could finally lead to gas car extinction 💪. A major shift to electric car owners means a massive drawback on carbon gas emissions and polluted cities 😷.

Main reason for the plummeting costs? Batteries are getting better and cheaper!

# [1 hour peddling 🚴 = 24 hours power 🔌  ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZzNuf32o08&feature=youtu.be)

It's called the [Free Electric Hybrid Bike](http://billionsinchange.com/solutions/free-electric). This bike has the potential to be very valuable for 1.3 billion people who have no access to any electricity whatsoever. Who knows in future we'll be peddling for only 10 minutes to power our house for a whole week!
