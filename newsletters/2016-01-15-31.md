Solar farms in the sky, how cool would that be? Nowadays solar energy relies on sunny weather, although a great sustainable technology, it hates clouds üå•. So, why not fly above them?

Their potential in generating energy is a staggering three times more than conventional solar panels. The beauty of these high altitude balloons is of course that they can go anywhere don't take any ground space.       

Let's get technical ü§ì. This is how it works:

Remember the [Solar Impulse](http://www.solarimpulse.com/) project? An airplane which flown around the world without fueling. This plane relies fully on solar power.

Pilot Andr√© Borschberg talks about future plans: Build solar drones to replace satellites üõ∞. According to Borschberg there's a growing demand to monitor the earth from above.  

"I'm sure that by observing from the sky we can improve the use of the land and the quality of the agriculture, as well as our knowledge of oceans and forests.‚Äù he said.
