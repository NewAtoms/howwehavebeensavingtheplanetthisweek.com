# Giant balloonsðŸŽˆ in the ocean?

Almost every week we can present a new form of storing sustainable energy! This time: A giant underwater balloon. The balloon is filled with high-pressured air which can be released to generate electricity when sustainable resources won't generate enough -- e.g. a calm nightðŸŒ™. The balloons are ideally placed 200 meters below sea level because the pressure will be equal on the inside and on the outside. The company Hydrostar promises 80% efficiency. 
What an amazing and crazy idea!
