# The format of a How We Have Been Saving The Planet This Week newsletter

We write a weekly newsletter on awesome things. This is maily these things:
- About how we are improving our environment creating a more liveable world for humans.
- Positive turn of events, that doesnâ€™t stress negativity too much. Sometimes you can use a non-positive article but just highlight the cool things about it.
- Current, maximally one week old on the sending date (maybe more if its cool).
- It has to have a cool picture that we can use in the Newsletter.
- A video is a definite plus.

Every newsletter contains the following:
